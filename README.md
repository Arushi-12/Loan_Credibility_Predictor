# Loan_Credibility_Predictor

This project aims to build a system for assessing creditworthiness for individuals lacking prior loan history. This involves analyzing alternative billing cycles they have engaged in and devising scoring metrics based on this data.

Traditional methods of credit scoring, such as evaluating credit history, collateral, or past accounts, may not offer fair opportunities to everyone to establish credit. Consequently, certain individuals may find it challenging to access fundamental banking services like opening a bank account or obtaining a loan. By leveraging existing datasets, we aim to gain insights into banks' track records and the necessity of conventional credit scoring.
